Hi Anas:
I received your submission - you put a serious effort in it and the result is good. It shows that you learned hands-one how to create mr applications using a nontrivial framework and you deployed your implementation on AWS EMR. Now, I have some critical points for you - otherwise, my feedback would be empty :-).

1. Your code may have more informative comments. For example, when you say "recursively create a list of tuples..." I don't  see any indication in the return type List[String] that you create tuples in the sense of the tuple type, Tuple2 that is (_.1, _.2). 
2. Your tests do not exist.
3. Your documentation is ok, although I would prefer to see a more in-depth discussion of your design choices and limitations.
4. You write better Scala code. At this point you should learn about monads, how to use Option, and switch to folds and maps and flatmaps instead of heavily using foreach nested loops.

Despite all that, you have done a good job. Your grade is 2.5%+3% bonus, a total of 5.5%.

Thank you,
Mark
